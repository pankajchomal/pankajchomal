## 🚀 About Me

Mission-driven **Technical Program Manager** with **26+ years of experience** delivering complex, software-intensive and system-integrated products in high-stakes, production-critical environments.

I specialise in operating in **low-structure, high-ambiguity settings** where speed, ownership, and engineering execution matter. I have a strong track record partnering directly with software, systems, and test engineers to manage dependencies, integration risk, and delivery trade-offs across the full lifecycle — from architecture and build through integration, test, and operational release.
